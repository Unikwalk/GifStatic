* When the user clicks on a button, the page grabs 10 static, non-animated gif images from the GIPHY API and places them on the page
* When the user clicks one of the still GIPHY images, the gif should animate. If the user clicks the gif again, it should stop playing
* Under every gif, display its rating (PG, G, so on)
* Add a form to take the value from a user input box and make the button on the page
